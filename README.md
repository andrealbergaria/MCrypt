Ok. So what is this repo? Ive found a way to factorize integers through a algorithm
Lets suppose that dividend = 6328 and want to get the factors of it.
So lets first divide by two (the divisor always start at 2, because its the smallest integer.

6328 | 2
       3164 | 2
       	     1582 | 2	
		   791 | 2 division doesnt return integer so try another number
		       | 3 same thing
		       | 4 same thing..it keeps adding up until we reach 7	  		
		       | 7 
		       	  113 .
		      
so the factors of 6328 are ={2,2,2,7,113}
